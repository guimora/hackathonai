# SimplePath
SimplePath software is an application oriented for Product Owners to support them by creating behaviors properly for any kind of requirement and removing possible ambiguous ideas. The creation of these behaviors is based on BDD (Behavior Driven Development) methodology to structure them with preconditions, actions, and expected results. At the end of this process, a new Jira ticket will be created with this information to provide visibility about how every component/requirement must be created to add value to the business.
